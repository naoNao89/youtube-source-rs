- Efficient JSON parsing and URL handling
- Minimal memory footprint

**Developer Experience:**
- Comprehensive test suite with >90% code coverage
- Automated CI/CD pipeline
- Cross-platform support
- Extensive documentation and examples

**Compatibility:**
- Lavalink v3.7+ and v4.0+ support
- All major operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Multiple CPU architectures (x86_64, aarch64)

For detailed usage instructions, see the [README](README.md) and [API documentation](https://docs.rs/youtube-source-rs).

### Breaking Changes

None - this is the initial release.

### Migration from Java

If you're migrating from the Java YouTube source implementation:

1. Disable the built-in YouTube source in your Lavalink configuration
2. Add the youtube-source-rust plugin dependency
3. Update your configuration to use the new plugin options
4. Test your setup with the provided integration tests

See the [Migration Guide](README.md#migration-from-java-implementation) for detailed instructions.

### Known Issues

- Some age-restricted content may require OAuth authentication
- Rate limiting may occur under high load without proper configuration
- Live streams always require transcoding (no Opus support)
